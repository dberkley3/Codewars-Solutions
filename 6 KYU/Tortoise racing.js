/* INSTRUCTIONS
Two tortoises named A and B must run a race. A starts with an average speed of 720 feet per hour. Young B knows she runs faster than A, and furthermore has not finished her cabbage.

When she starts, at last, she can see that A has a 70 feet lead but B's speed is 850 feet per hour. How long will it take B to catch A?

More generally: given two speeds v1 (A's speed, integer > 0) and v2 (B's speed, integer > 0) and a lead g (integer > 0) how long will it take B to catch A?

The result will be an array [hour, min, sec] which is the time needed in hours, minutes and seconds (round down to the nearest second) or a string in some languages. */

//ANSWER

function race(v1, v2, g) {
    let time = g / (v2 - v1);
  console.log(time)
  return v2 > v1 ? [Math.floor(time), Math.floor((time * 60) % 60), Math.floor((time * 3600) % 60) ] : null;
}
