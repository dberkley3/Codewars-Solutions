/* INSTRUCTIONS
Given three integers a ,b ,c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the following operators and brackets: +, *, ()
In other words , try every combination of a,b,c with [*+()] , and return the Maximum Obtained */

//ANSWER

function expressionMatter(a, b, c) {
    let output = [];
    output.push(a *(b + c));
    output.push(a * b * c);
    output.push(a + b * c);
    output.push((a + b) * c);
    output.push(a+b+c);
      return Math.max(...output)
  }
